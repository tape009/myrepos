			<h3>story rewview</h3> 
				<p>the story of smt if start off with just a normal school day untill when the day end everone relize the school has been move to another space  a world call the expanse in a rush you can pick one of 3 stuidne to fallow you into the expans 
		to stop it and bring back the school. the games story is very meh the plot point are few and far between but I do love the idea of the game. I will give it some slack sincn it a snes game.  the charter route have diffen moventes charil want to get out.
		yumi want to save the kid and rekios route want to save the person who doing this.
		
		</P>
				<h3> gameplay rewview</h3>
					<P> I will say this, this game has some of the most unfun and fustring gameplay in the whole sires and that saying a lot this game is a pain to play. ok so unlike more reacent smt games this game dose not have the press turn system it a more regerl jrpg 
						with simple turn base combact you can requirt demon still and fuse. also the mc cant use magic so if your playing this dont put any point in that stat  well weakness are still in this game it only make skill do more damge. y
						you can have up to 5 demon in your party with the person you deicside to take to the expanse  but haveing demon comsue mag something you get from killing demon if you dont have any and you have a demon out it
						will take damge. now it time to take about they really fun part the dugone the are the worst you wont think this with the few first few one but you will sooner or later the puzzle/mazzen suck not fun at all and it dosent help how high this game 
						inecorer rate is.
		</P>
		<h3> prestion</h3>
				<p> the game look pretty ok for a snes game. and the pixle art look pretty alright.the dugeon on the other hand is very sameing  most of the texter are just palit swaps. but one thing I will give this game is the music I still cant belive this was on 
			a snes  it mosty rock and meatal but it really fit the games.<P>
		<h2>Final rating</h2> 
			<p> 3/10. Pro: it a cool idea. con: very little story,painfull gameplay,samey dugeon  and just really fustring.</P>
