			<h3>story rewview</h3> 
				<p> smt 4 start off in the kingdom of maskdo a wide  kingdom  going for miles and miles you play as a commer who one day gose up to the kindom so the can find the next samuri a group of soider that protech the kindom from treath and demons
		the game start off quite boring i found the first few hours of the game quite bland at that but after the second dugeon the story get a lot better. the charter are fine the 4 major one are walter,isabeau and jonthen if you played smt befor you
will know what these charter are about.		</P>
		<h3> gameplay rewview</h3>
			<P> I will just start off with saying this i love this game gameplay it so much fun compare to other jrpgs. so this game is turn base and it has the press turn system from smt 3 and this is how it work so you go thew dungeon and requriting demone
	you can have 3 demon in your party at once for each demon you have you get a press turn this is your action you have befor it the emney turn. most demon have a weakness that can be fire,ice,wind, elc, light,dark or phys or gun. each skill is one of these emlemnt
	and hiting a demon weakness will turn one of your press turn into a half press turn passing will do this too makeing it so you can have up to 8 action on your turn. if you hit a weakness that a demon null or repeal you will loss press turn.ok I know that was alot
	but it really make this game shine the game also has a fusion system where you take two or more demon and fuse them into a new one. all these system make the game really really fun if you know how the systme work you can total break this game  I know I did. even if
	you dont like the story I really recomed you stay for the gameplay</P>
			<h3> prestion</h3>
					<p> this game diffent from most smt game in the fact the artest Kazuma Kaneko did not do the art this was the first mainline game where he didnt. and well the new artest dio did do a good job it just feel off 
	kaneko art had such a diffen style well the game still look great even for a 3ds game it dosent feel smt like. there are many cool art thing witht this game the evnmorent look great and there a lot of cool area in this game<P>
					<h2>Final rating</h2> 
							<p> 8.5/10. Pro: fun gameplay and the game look great. con: boring story and just ok charter.</P>
